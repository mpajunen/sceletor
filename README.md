# Sceletor

A declarative logic library written in TypeScript.

## Installing

```
npm install @mpajunen/sceletor
```
or
```
yarn add @mpajunen/sceletor
```

## Motivation

Sometimes a simple, structured format is optimal for representing conditions.
Structured rules are easy to serialize and reasonably manipulable.

A limited set of structured rules also makes it possible to easily combine and
simplify conditions.
